# Electric Circus - game-based co-design for digital ecosystems
Electric Circus is a process and tools, set in a game-based framework for enabling the human-centered & computer-aided design of cyberphysical ecosystems. 

We strive to _safely_ remove the "-" in cyber-physical. See

## Principles

**(1) Start from 1st principles** and aid participants in ethical modes of [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason) and [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)

Insights from upgrading the 2nd cohort of Token Engineering Academy with "An Interface to Moral Philosophy"

**(2) Mesh [Human-centric Design](https://freeel.io/workshops#start) with [Computer-aided Design](https://cadcad.org/)**

Impressions from Odyssey Connect, Febrauary 2020 - when we co-designed a boardgame with stakeholders IRL:

**(3) Make it [Fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_game)**

Ergo, use game for co-creation!  (share the love for self.referential systems? start [contributing!]() ;) )

## Origins and Direction

The current presence is funded & hosted by Freeelio [here](https://freeel.io/workshops#rpg). We aim to spin Electric Circus own GitHub Organization, supporting all the customized online ecosystem games in their own repositories. In the prototyping phase all pilots will be branches to this repository.

Electric Circus is inspired by our own learning experience in [NextGenerationInternet Ledger](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ledger/), our continued [experiments with the Token Engineering community](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444), and finally in the TE Academy Ecosystem Valueflows course [Part 3 "Games & Governance"](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-tmg1-ecosystem/#part-3-games--governance). Between November 2019 and now, we tested the promise and limits of cyber-physical (with the "-") game-based learning and co-creation of digitial ecosystems. 

We have gathered critical feedback and supporters, e.g.

* **Analysis** in "The Colors of Play - Re-thinking Organizations through re-cognizing the fluid nature of play" Master Thesis, 'defended and graded highest' (state of the art measuring conventions of success, Electric Circus will help in transcending ;) - but the thesis insights are very valuable irrespective of measuring tools, [see for yourself!](https://issuu.com/nikolajjunkermadsen/docs/masterthesis_design_126829_123274)) in May 2020, pp 91-92
* **Letter of Support** from [Odyssey Momentum](https://www.odyssey.org/momentum/) ( Originally a global - physical - hackathon, which had to make the transition from a planned IRL hackathon in April 2020 to a Massive Online Collaboration VR environment in November 13, 2020)

## Planned Outcomes
With these insights & interest we will develop open source online versions of Electric Circus - game-based co-design for ecosystems - , which draws from the Ecosystem Valueflows course insights (over 50 participants, 2 cohorts, and continuing), greatly inspired by [Le Grand Jeu](https://github.com/freddbomba/legrandjeu/blob/master/doc/legrandjeu.md) and the simplifications and generalizations presented by the [Ecosystem Design Toolkit](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit):

- Goal 1 (150k): Web-based customizeable version, with 3 pilot ecosystems:
  - (1) Impact Pirates (requires additional funding [link gitcoin grant], ecosystem partners are bringing in best effort and in-kind contributions)
  - (2) [DADA.art Invisible Economy](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-db46897d4f07) (to be funded as part of their token economy launch preparation)
  - (3) Electraseed Fund (in incubation by Freeelio the Open Innovation Collective)
  
In the prototyping phase all pilots will be branches to this repository.

 
- Goal 2 (375k): [AR/VR-based](https://www.alistdaily.com/digital/vr-ar-moving-toward-web/) version, based on learning from Web-based prototoype:
  - (1) Odyssey Momentum (see letter of interest)
  - (2) [2nd early access partner slot](mailto:sebnem@freeel.io)
  - (3) [3rd early access partner slot](mailto:sebnem@freeel.io)
